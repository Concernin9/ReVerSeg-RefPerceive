## 📌 Overview

**ReVerSeg** is a training-free inference framework designed for short-clip language-driven traffic video segmentation.
It improves robustness against semantic ambiguity and error propagation by introducing:

- Semantic-aware keyframe selection  
- Two-stage verification (bounding-box verification and mask verification)  
- Explicit reasoning and correction during inference
